            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2015: C</h3>
            <p>
              C langugae was my first programming language. When I was first
              introduced to programming, I initially didn't realise the purpose
              of writing code, its real time usage and stuff. Yet I managed to
              learn how to write programs using C. I've invested quite a lot of
              my time in using this language.

            <p>
              Later I was introduced to the world of Obect Oriented Programming.
              I resisted to shift myself into a new language at first as I was
              very comfortable with C. But later I started to learn how C++ and
              Java actually differ from C, and why I should opt OOP over POP.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Data structures and Algorithms are so crucial for a CS student. I
              first faced difficulty in using advanced data structures and
              algorithms for different use cases. This is when I started to code
              on hackerrank. Later, I actually got well versed in DSA after
              especially taking a GFG course which gave me clear insights about
              complexities and different ways to approach a problem starting
              from naive to an optimal solution with least possible time and
              space complexities.

            </h3>
            <p>
              I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS in this period. I also used
              PHP as a backend programming language to actually handle data
              captured from browser.

            <p>
              Database is a place to store data. And querying is the way for
              communicating with database. I did quite a lot of querying. I have
              quite good experience in working with relational databases like
              MySQL and SQLite.

            <p>
              Python is the most user friendly language that I came across. It
              takes less effort in implementing a functionality compared to
              other programming languages. I did use python for over a year with
              Django.

            <p>
              Django is a python-based MVC design pattern. Django is my first
              experience with practical implementation of MVC architecture. I
              had quite good experience in software development life-cycle which
              includes writing user stories and planning tasks for jira, writing
              code with TDD(Unit and integration tests using pytest), and
              developing REST apis, CI/CD(Codeship), TravisCI.

            <p>
              For a goal to become a full stack web developer, I've learnt the
              modern markup and styling languages to start with. I took up
              courses on udemy and laid a strong foundation.

            <p>
              Inorder to keep myself up-to-date with the latest advancements in
              modern CSS, I've learnt tools like 2D & 3D transforms,
              transitions, animations, RWD techniques like flex, media queries,
              grid, and more. I've built few mini projects using these, out of
              which this site is one !

            <p>
              Sass provided an environment like other programming languages to
              do styling, which is cool! I also had handson experience in using
              Sass.

            <p>
              I realised its important to code everyday. And I could'nt make
              time for CP. So I wanted to solve problems, post solutions
              whenever I get time. It is C++ STL that most of the programmers
              use for less execution time. So this made me learn C++ STL lib
              which I am new to. Now I am well versed with stl and this is the
              language that I use on online platforms.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2020: JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              Javascript is the most famous language for both frontend and
              backend applications(like nodejs). So it is important to be
              familiar with JS. I again took up a udemy course for this and
              learnt advancements right from basic ES5 to latest ES6. I also
              built few projects using DOM and JS concepts(ES5 & ES6).

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> 2020: TypeScript</h3>
            <p>
              TS is the superset of JS. So its been easy to learn TS, lot more
              after JS version ES6 was introduced. My urge to learn and use
              angular made me learn typescript actually.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Well, angular is the most robust framework compared to other
              trending frameworks like reactjs, vuejs. I wanted to start with
              angualar, so in the quest of exploring angualar.
